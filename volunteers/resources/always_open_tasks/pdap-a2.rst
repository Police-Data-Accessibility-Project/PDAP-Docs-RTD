PDAP A-2: Write an automated data scraper
=========================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data can be found from a vast array of sources. Turn a manual human effort into an automated task.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
========
You’re going to program a :doc:`legal data scraper </volunteers/resources/legal_restrictions>` and process a sample data file. For example, you could be using Python to turn a PDF of police activities into JSON, or making recurring API calls to pull down files.

Step 1. Claim a source
----------------------------
Navigate to our :doc:`Dataset Catalog </data_collection/data_sources/catalog>` and claim one that’s unfinished. You can also find a source that matters to you on your own.

Step 2. Rules of the road.
-------------------------------
Head to the Github `Scrapers readme <https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/blob/master/SCRAPERS.md>`_ to make sure you’re following the submission guidelines.

Step 3. Submit your work.
---------------------------
Due to the `Scrapers repo <https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/Scrapers/tree/master/USA>`_ is a pull request containing the following in the appropriate file path based on the location of your source data.
e.g. **Pennsylvania > City of Pittsburgh or Michigan > Washtenaw County**
- Your scraper code, with inline links to and description of the source
- An example, both in its original and scraped .csv format


Process the data.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do as much as you can to turn the data from the starting format (often PDF) to something closer to Excel, CSV or JSON format. If you can’t do any of that—no sweat! We have other experts for processing the data you collect.

Compile the data.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Convert it into a .zip file. If you have processed the data, include both the original data, anything you used to do conversion, and the cleaned up submission material. 

Send it to us!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a Keybase account and submit it to the Keybase Intake form. This should take 5 minutes, and helps us keep track of who’s submitting data!
Use the data upload form here to send your data. If you have any questions, refer to #volunteer-data in Slack.
