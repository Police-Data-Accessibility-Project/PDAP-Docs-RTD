Intake process
==============

1. A list of open tasks is maintained in Jira, and ported to a task list via an Add-On called coupler.io. Issues refresh hourly on a hidden sheet accessible by @pdap.io members only.
2. Volunteers join the Slack, where they are welcomed by a GreetBot message. It points them to the primary onboarding doc.

    Hi @new_user_name! Welcome to the Police Data Accessibility Project neighborhood.
    This is a space for conversation, inquiry, and action toward a common goal. Don’t be shy if you have a way to push us in the direction of our goal: a source of truth for police data. The knowledge you share will make better tools. 
    
    1. Give your account a non-default avatar and a full name.
    2. To contribute in any way, `head here for a quick onboarding <https://pdap-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ and identify how you can help.
    3. Introduce yourself and ask questions in #_volunteer-start!

    Note: Please abide by the Universal Code of Conduct.

3. A pinned message in the #_volunteer-start channel directs people to our `Intake Form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13HiD4CNTq8DOlwQtbIw2CfSjjDlveBpwxr7LRtcKeIo/edit>`_. We’d really like people to fill that out.
4. At least one person from the Leadership group DMs the new volunteer in Slack to welcome them to the group. They already have everything they need to get started, but it’s helpful to have one **high-context point of contact**. Let’s rotate informally for now—if you’re getting overwhelmed with onboarding questions, let the group know!


If they try to submit data or code, we’ll make sure they have submitted the Intake Form as well as the `Keybase Intake Form <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wVxuP7n-yqDQ-LKiQWj0uABh7exlLNOl1r7WYz-CiXY>`_.
