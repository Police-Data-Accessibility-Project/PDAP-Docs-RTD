Data formats are inconsistent at best, confusing at worst. Splunk config files are how we standardize each data source.

Overview & Setup
================
Splunk is an intelligence analysis tool to make sense of vast amounts of data.
    - **can run python script to save sanitized snapshots** on a recurring basis
    - **can make API requests** to other APIs, and has an API to make requests against
    - **can save alerts** for the appearance of specific data

Hosted
------
`Access it here <http://144.202.93.42:8000/en-US/app/launcher/home>`_. For this iteration, there’s a shared username and password. Reach out to Alec Akin for it.
This is installed on a $10 Vultr instance with 2gb ram, 55gb ssd, and 1 core.

Local
-----
If you want to install a private instance for local use, it only takes about 10 minutes to set up on Mac or Windows. `Here’s where to get started <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html?utm_campaign=google_amer_en_search_brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=Splunk_Enterprise_Demo&utm_term=splunk&_bk=splunk&_bt=432128662491&_bm=p&_bn=g&_bg=76270518373&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQiAh4j-BRCsARIsAGeV12AkmyhGC7IiT6h1pQWlxvUPd3TshA5EDTDFpZ1gAyFvtp67yfMPvc0aAhloEALw_wcB>`_.

Example use cases
=================
When fed a batch of 3,000,000 documents from `NIBRS <https://pdap.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~165665269/pages/49611252/Data+sources>`_, it quickly revealed that the 8 days responsible for the most hate crime in the United States were those immediately following September 11. The 9th was the final day of the `Rodney King riots <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots#Day_4_%E2%80%93_Saturday,_May_2>`_.
It’s also a way to power parts of the site: a front end app could consume parts of the Splunk API.

Basic usage
===========
Here’s how to make queries in SPL, Splunk’s proprietary searching language.
**Sample query: **
::

    index=nibrs source="hatecrimes.csv" incident_date="12-SEP-01"
