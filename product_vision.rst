------------------------------------------------------
PDAP aims to be a **Source of Truth** for police data.
------------------------------------------------------

There are about 18,000 police organizations, and each has a unique way to make data public. This means that, effectively, **the data is not public**. We can make it public by consolidating it.
We speculate that the key audience is **data scientists and journalists**. They do the analysis, and are the critical channel for information to flow from police organizations to policymakers and the general public.

*We become more effective as we scale each of these services:*
:highlight-red:`Collection` → :highlight-orange:`Storage` → :highlight-yellow:`Standardization` → :highlight-green:`Access` (→ Analysis)

:highlight-red:`Collection` is the group of automated and manual processes that legally gather police data. 

1. Automated data scrapers regularly consolidate public police information.
2. Humans operate semi-automated processes to gather public information.
3. Facilitate data sharing by good-faith police organizations.

:highlight-orange:`Storage` must be archival, verifiable, and secure. There are three distinct types.

1. A Holding Ground where data can be dropped, where it is checked for integrity and security.
2. A Gold Standard, the unified archive that we manage.
3. A public-facing portal that's as accessible and standardized as possible.

:highlight-yellow:`Standardization` normalizes information into a unified format. This facilitates analysis and access at a larger scale.

:highlight-green:`Access` means hosting data for citizens and data scientists. 
This is anything between a direct download and API web hooks.
