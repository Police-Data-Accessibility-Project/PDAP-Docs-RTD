Password Management Policy
==========================

--------------------------------------------------------
Ensuring PDAP keeps tools and services in its ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------

What’s the policy?
==================
The following must be true for new services:
1. Eddie Brown has admin or owner access.
2. At least 3 people from the #leadership slack channel has admin or owner access, to the extent it’s possible.
“Admin or owner access” confers the ability to manage users/members, and billing.
