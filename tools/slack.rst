Introduction
============
You can join our `Slack here <https://join.slack.com/t/policeaccessibility/shared_invite/zt-ial0bvnm-D_T7R6za4aKh1f9jGUM0pg>`_. By default, you will join the following channels:

- ``#_announcements``
- ``#_general``
- ``#_introduceyourself``
- ``#_requests``

After introducing yourself in  ``#_introduceyourself``, head to the channel browser to add yourself to more channels that may line up with your level of expertise!
